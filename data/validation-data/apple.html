Just answer a few questions about your device and its condition. Based on what you tell us, we’ll provide an estimated trade-in value. Footnote ∆ If you buy online and choose to pay with Apple Card Monthly Installments, we’ll apply the value as an instant credit to lower the monthly payments of your new device. If you pay in full, we’ll credit your payment method after we receive your trade-in. And if it’s not eligible for credit, we’ll provide a simple way to recycle it for free.\nIf it’s eligible for trade-in, we’ll mail you a free trade-in kit. You may receive it along with your new device. Otherwise it will be mailed to you separately as soon as your order is ready for delivery or pickup. Once you receive the trade-in kit, you have 14 days to prepare and send in your device.\nOnce we receive your trade-in, we'll inspect it and verify its condition. If everything checks out, there’s nothing more you need to do. If your device doesn’t match the condition you described, you’ll receive an email with next steps. If you paid in full and the value of your device was more than the cost of your new Mac, you’ll receive an Apple Gift Card by email with the remaining amount.\nThe online trade-in process can take up to 2 to 3 weeks. You can also trade in your device at an Apple Store at the point of purchase. However, the trade-in value in-store may be different from the estimated trade-in value you received online."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What protection does AppleCare offer?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"AppleCare+ extends the standard warranty for your new Mac.

                                                    <p>Apple Trade In makes it easy to get credit toward the purchase of your new Mac. Just answer a few questions about your device and its condition. Based on what you tell us, we’ll provide an estimated trade-in value.<as-footnote data-id="64dae4ad8f7828e82c803175386770f9" data-assigned="true"><sup data-autom="footnote-sub" class="as-footnote"><span class="visuallyhidden">&nbsp;Footnote&nbsp;</span>∆</sup></as-footnote> If you buy online and choose to pay with Apple Card Monthly Installments, we’ll apply the value as an instant credit to lower the monthly payments of your new device. If you pay in full, we’ll credit your payment method after we receive your trade-in. And if it’s not eligible for credit, we’ll provide a simple way to recycle it for free.</p>
<p>If it’s eligible for trade-in, we’ll mail you a free trade-in kit. You may receive it along with your new device. Otherwise it will be mailed to you separately as soon as your order is ready for delivery or pickup. Once you receive the trade-in kit, you have 14 days to prepare and send in your device.</p>
<p>Once we receive your trade-in, we'll inspect it and verify its condition. If everything checks out, there’s nothing more you need to do. If your device doesn’t match the condition you described, you’ll receive an email with next steps. </p>
<p>If you paid in full and the value of your device was more than the cost of your new Mac, you’ll receive an Apple Gift Card by email with the remaining amount.</p>
<p>The online trade-in process can take up to 2 to 3 weeks. You can also trade in your device at an Apple Store at the point of purchase. However, the trade-in value in-store may be different from the estimated trade-in value you received online.</p>

Existing customers: See your Customer Agreement for your variable APR. As of January 1, 2026, the variable APR on new Apple Card accounts ranges from 17.49% to 27.74%. You must elect to use ACMI at checkout. If you buy an ACMI-eligible product with a one-time payment on Apple Card at checkout, that purchase is subject to your Apple Card’s variable APR, not the ACMI 0% APR. Taxes and shipping on items purchased using ACMI are subject to your Apple Card’s variable APR, not the ACMI 0% APR. In order to buy an iPhone with ACMI, you must select one of the following carriers (prepaid carrier plans are not supported): AT&amp;T, Boost Mobile, T-Mobile, or Verizon. An iPhone purchased with ACMI is always unlocked, so you can switch carriers at any time, subject to your carrier’s terms. ACMI is not available for purchases made at the following special storefronts or when using these discounts in-store at Apple: Apple Employee Purchase Plan; participating corporate Employee Purchase Programs; Apple at Work for small businesses; Government and Veterans and Military Purchase Programs; or on refurbished devices. The last month’s payment for each product will be the product’s purchase price, less all other payments at the monthly payment amount. ACMI is subject to change at any time for any reason, including but not limited to installment term lengths and eligible products.
